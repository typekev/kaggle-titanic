> Capstone Project &ndash; Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Software and libraries

Some libraries that I chose to use are `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn`. No special libraries from outside of this program were used. Everything I've built is based on what I learned in this program.

The project was built and tested in a SageMaker notebook, so the `sagemaker` package is also used.

The model is built using the `sagemaker` `xgboost` container.

## Datasets

The data you need to run this project is all here in this repository already. But the data can also be downloaded [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

My submission data is also available in this repository, but it can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/typekev/competitions) as well.

## Proposal and report

My "Capstone Proposal" and "Capstone Report" can be viewed in this repository. See `capstone-report.pdf` and `proposal.pdf`.
